	robo3d_r1plus_e3d_a.stl - Rendered STL part A (larger bracket)
	robo3d_r1plus_e3d_b.stl - Rendered STL part B (smaller retaining clip)

# Other Needed Parts

	- Nema Extruder Kit (like: https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/seemecnc-ezrstruder-kit/sk/MWHJ83XV)
	- 4mm PTFE Tube
	- 3mm Bolts/Nuts/Washers
	- E3D Head (V6?)

# How to Assemble

Want to say the design is pretty straight forward.

There are four holes.

Attach part A to the carriage via the two holes parallel to the printer's Z-axis.

Attach part B to part A via the two holes orthogonal to the printer's Z-axis (don't forget to sandwich the head in there).

# Todo

Will add pictures as soon as parts come in?
